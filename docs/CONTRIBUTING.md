 **Coding standard**
 
  Any python code added is expected to be up to PEP8 standard https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. 
It’s not terribly complicated, it’s mostly just to make things look nice and easy to read for anyone else wanting to contribute. 
Any C code that needs to be written is to NASA standard http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/dts/pm/Papers/nasa-c-style.pdf. 
Also not terribly complicated, just to make things look nice and easy to read. 
Most methods that need to be worked on already have method stubs (def method_name(args):) that simply need to be filled in.
